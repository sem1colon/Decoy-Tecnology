#Decoy Tecnology

Cloud Computing has been intrinsicallychanging the way we utilize computers to keepand retrieve our personal & business data. With the advent of this emerging paradigm of computing, it arises the new security challenges. Existent cryptographic data security techniques i.e., encryption deteriorated in  preventing  data  theft  attacks  once  the  key  is  compromised,  especially  those  perpetrated  by  insiders. Cloud Security Alliance reckoned this threatas a significant danger of Cloud Computing. Although the majority of Cloud users are very much known of this risk, they are left over with the only choice of trusting the cloud service provider, regards to their data protection. In this paper, we propose an alternate way to secure data on the cloud which is more efficient and secure by the concoction of user profile mapping using Hadoop framework and offensive decoy technology.
